  CollectableDescription: " I don\u2019t know how much my actions make them feel
    pain, or suffering, and I don\u2019t know how it affects their personalities.
    I often wonder if they act differently with their cagemates, if they seem like
    a \u201Cnew rat\u201D when they return. For some rats it is even worse \u2013
    my actions mean they can no longer live with other rats. They get a whole cage
    to themselves, but they aren\u2019t allowed to spend time with other rats again
    in case they get hurt. "
