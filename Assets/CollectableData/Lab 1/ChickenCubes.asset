  CollectableDescription: 'NEW TEST REQUIREMENT:  We''ve started receiving requests
    from our sponsors to provide measurement of the rats athletic ability,along with
    the request that our rats undertake the tests in a state closer to their activity
    in the wild. In order to meet these requests, all lab tests must now contain
    an obstacle course for the rat to undertake before they are presented with the
    central focus of the experiment. This is to encourage the rats sense of wild
    exploration and will also allow us to gauge the rats physical abilities during
    testing. '
