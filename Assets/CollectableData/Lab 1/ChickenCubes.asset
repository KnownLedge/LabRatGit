  CollectableDescription: My work involves working with rodents, which to some readers
    will not be pleasant. But these creatures help us each day to unlock more about
    how our brains work. As a researcher my work requires me to record what is going
    on in individual nerve cells (neurons). To do that I must act as a surgeon, and
    add things to my rodent colleagues that let me record these cells whilst they
    are still alive.
