  CollectableDescription: "I think, for me, the problem is one of choice. My rats
    don\u2019t choose to be lab rats. They don\u2019t get a list of options, and
    can\u2019t walk away from their life. It is all determined by my actions and
    the actions of my colleagues. Some people don\u2019t think rats can think like
    we can. That they don\u2019t know \u201Cwho\u201D they are. They aren\u2019t
    sentient. In that case, working with a rat, with a tree, and with a bacteria
    are all the same. These people don\u2019t have to worry. I see how rats behave
    every day. I can\u2019t accept they don\u2019t know themselves.  "
