  CollectableDescription: When I work, I am recording from a living brain, firing
    electricity and chemicals and sending information back and forward and making
    a creature live. Each rat tells me something which unlocks a new piece of information
    about how biology works. There is value in what I produce which is not just valuable
    to me, but to all humans, even to rats.
