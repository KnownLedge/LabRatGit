  CollectableDescription: "Should I be doing this? Is the cost I inflict on these
    rats worth it? Am I morally wrong or right? My answers to these questions changes
    every time I think on them. My work tells us a lot about how memories are formed,
    how they are processed, and how they are remembered. This helps others make treatments
    for awful diseases like dementia. It helps teachers to create new ways of learning.
    Without these surgeries, we would not know this information, and so we wouldn\u2019t
    be able to improves the lives of others. "
