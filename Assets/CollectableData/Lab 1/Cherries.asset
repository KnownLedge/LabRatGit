  CollectableDescription: "This part of my work never gets easier. Technically, working
    to get wires thinner than a human hair close enough to one specific brain cell
    out of 21 million is tough. More so when written out like that! But what\u2019s
    tougher is when I think about how my actions effect my rats. I can\u2019t tell
    them in advance what I am going to do, and I can\u2019t reassure them that things
    will be OK when they wake up from surgery"
