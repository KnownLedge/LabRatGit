  CollectableDescription: "Is the life of a human worth more than a rat? More than
    several rats? From what I do I have to say yes to these questions, but it makes
    me uneasy. If I could I would work with humans, or work with computer models,
    or single cells in a dish. But none of these methods work if you don\u2019t have
    an idea of how things work together. We simply don\u2019t know enough to be really
    sure these ways would tell us the truth.  "
