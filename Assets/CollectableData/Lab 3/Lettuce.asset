  CollectableDescription: The Maas lab is uniquely equipped with our own method of
    eliciting natural prey behaviour. Our predator system is able to interact with
    GRIDS to create perceptual experiences which match to brain activity seen in
    exposure to real predators of rodents, such as owls, foxes etc. Whilst not yet
    able to specify a particular verifiable predator, the system is highly effective
    at triggering fear responses.
