  CollectableDescription: The predator unit consists of several sensory emitters,
    is mobile, and able to respond to direct commands or use a proprietary AI system
    to generate complex patterns of behaviour. The unit can produce smell, sound,
    and minor visual signals so as to trigger the fear state, with different levels
    of arousal possible through how these are deployed.
