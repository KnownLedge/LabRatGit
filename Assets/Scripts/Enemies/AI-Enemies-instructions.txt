AI-Enemies-instructions

Pathfinder:-
the pathfinder will patrol with in a fixed number position/targets.
have two more assigned targets inside the inspector and the enemy will get within certain range of the current target and then 
wait for set amount of time before move to the next target in the list, the enemy will repeat this list after completion.
the distance and "rest time" can be altered inside unity's inspector with D2T being the distance and resetTime being the rest time.

Wonder:-
the wonder will randomly find points to move to.
the wonder will randomly pick these within a radius of itself, you can change the size of this radius inside the inspector.

chaser:- 
the chaser will cause enemies to follow the player, there is no attack function so the enemy will just bump into the player.
the chaser script will need the player to assigned inside the script.

AI_Sight:-
the AI sight will allow the enemies to see the player (I do have plans for it to see the environment for better navigation but there not working yet).
the AI sight using ray to detect the player if they are Infront of enemy. the amount of rays and how far they are shot can be customized inside the 
inspector. the chase range determines how far within a circle does the enemy chase the player.

State Manager:-
the state manager controls the current state of the enemy based on information gathered from the AI_Sight.
make sure there are only behaviours assigned inside the behaviours list as only two states and transitions are programmed. the order of the states 
matter, make sure the intend enemy behaviour(wonder/pathfinder) is in first and the chaser is second.

problems:-
for both pathfinder and wonder make sure the target y position is the same as the enemies or they will do weird stuff or turn off the rigidbody and 
see what happens :>
